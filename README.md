<!--/h-->

### Installation Steps

1. Download the project with `git clone https://github.com/cgdsoftware/genealogy.git`

2. Copy .env.example to .env and edit details

3. `composer install` or on Windows you need to use `composer install --ignore-platform-reqs`

4. `php artisan key:generate`

5. `php artisan serve`
In order to serve the back-end API, take a look at the Local Development Server section of the [Laravel installation documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/#installation)
and consider using [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/valet) for a better experience

6. Run `php artisan migrate --seed`

7. Follow installation steps for client side (https://github.com/cgd-ui/genealogy) and launch the site and log into the project with user: `admin@familytree365.com`, password: `password`

8. (optional) Setup the configuration files as needed, in `config/enso/*.php`

9. (maybe required) Setup sanctum stateful domains in `.env` and add your domains to `config/cors.php`


## Import test data

1. Make sure php artisan queue:work is running

2. Make sure root database user is being used.

3. Register a new user and login.

4. Go to gedcom / import and upload https://github.com/cgdsoftware/public-gedcoms/blob/master/files/royal92.ged
